**Problem Specification : Vales for crop, soil chemical composition like N, P,and K , temperature, humididty,ph, moisture which is called here as rainfall will be provided. The detailed description about each terms is given below:
**N - It is the ratio of Nirtogen content present in the soil
**P - It is the ratio of Phosphorous content present in the soil
**K - It is the ratio of Potassium content present in the soil
**Temperature - Temperature is given in degree celcious
**humidity - relative humidity in %
**ph value- It is the PH value of soil
**Rainfall: It is for moisture present in the soil. It is in mm .
**Crop: It is the target variable for crop
**So here the main work is to predict the type of crop that can be grown on soil on the basis of given inputs from sensors.
